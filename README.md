In this project, I practised **Test Driven Development** using **Jest** and **Object Oriented Programming**. The goal was to create the main Factory Functions and test functionality. It was built with **HTML, SASS and Javascript**.

I used Test Driven Development with my factory functions (the ships, player and gameboard). There were fewer bugs, and the bugs that remained were generally easy to fix since the tests had allowed me to remove any outstanding ones.

## How to play

- Drag and drop the ships onto the grid. Rotate the ships by double-clicking on the end of the ship that wiggles (doesn't work on mobile)
- Alternatively, you can use the auto place button.
- Once the game start, click on the squares to attack the enemy ships.
- Winner is the first one to sink all of the enemies ships

## Technical details

### 1. Test-Driven Development

Since this was my first time trying out TDD, it wasn't the most efficient process. However, after some time, I began to realise how important and useful it is. Instead of merely creating and debugging, I had to think about how the app would work whilst implement different tests.

### 2. Pipe function

Using pipe is a powerful way to write procedural code and chain functions together. Using a pipe function helped me write simpler code whilst also making the code more declarative and easy to update.
