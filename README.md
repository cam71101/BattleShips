In this project, I practised **Test Driven Development** using **Jest** and **Object Oriented Programming**. The goal was to create the main Factory Functions and test its proper functionality. It was built with **HTML, SASS and Javascript**.

I used Test Driven Development with my factory functions (the ships, player and gameboard). This proved to be extremely useful - although the production of the entire app may have been slightly slower. There were fewer bugs and the bugs that remained were generally easy to fix since the tests had allowed me to remove any outstanding ones.

## Things I learnt throughout the project

### 1. Test-Driven Development

Since this was my first time trying out TDD, it wasn't the most efficient process. However, after some time, I began to realise how important and useful it is. Instead of simply creating and debugging, I had to think about how the app would work, what should the functions return, how to test the different functions and how to implement them.

### 2. Pipe function

Using pipe is a powerful way to write procedural code and chain functions together. Using a pipe function helped me to write simpler code whilst also making the code more declarative and easy to update.

### 3. HTML Drag and Drop API

I spent a lot of time experimenting with this API - with two small side-projects. I created a simple implementation of dragging icons onto their correct corresponding containers. I then created a prototype version of how the Drag and Drop API would work with a grid system and dragging containers onto the grid. This tutorial proved to be really useful for understanding how to use the API methods. Finally, I implemented the drag and drop functionality into the project, which wasn't a seamless process but eventually it worked out.
